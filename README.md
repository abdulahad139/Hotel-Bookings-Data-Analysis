# Hotel-Bookings-Data-Analysis
GOAL: Develop a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data
REQUIREMENTS: 
1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year? (we have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type)
2. Should we increase our parking lot size? (we want to understand if there is a trend is guest with personal cars)
3. What trends can we see in the data? (Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality)
